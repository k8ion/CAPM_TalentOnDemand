This is a replica of actual TalentOnDemand  portal  used by Deloitte employees. Deloitte’s Talent on Demand (ToD) is an internal portal where professionals manage their skills profile and access talent self‑service (e.g., benefits, leave, recognition, learning), and it supports staffing/resource planning by helping match people to project needs.
